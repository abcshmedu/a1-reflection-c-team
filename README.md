  **Status:**
- Annotated fields and methods information gets printed out correctly.
- Checkstyle complains about public fields in SomeClass. Apparently fine, since we need them to be.
Also there is a weird complain about tab-space at the beginning of the file of SomeClass.

  **Todos:**
- Check tab-complaint from checkstyle.
